# js-starter with react react-router babel sass and eslint

A UI that gives users the ability to add notes, edit them, rearrange them, and undo their steps. I was able to do most of the extra credit I tried: I added the ability to undo, to snap to grid, to pop the notes to the front when being dragged or clicked once. however, when the title is too long, I struggled making the grid functionality take that into account because of the extended width of the note.
